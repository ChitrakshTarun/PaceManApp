# PaceMan App

A mobile app to query [PaceMan.gg](https://paceman.gg/).

# Tech Stack

The PaceMan App is a React Native, Expo Project, and works on Android and iOS. The following is the complete tech stack used for the app.

### Frameworks, Tools & Languages

- React Native
- Expo
- JavaScript/TypeScript

### Dependencies

- `expo-router` File-based routing
- `nativewind` Tailwind CSS for React Native
- `react-native-reanimated` App Animations
- `react-native-gesture-handler` Gesture Handling
- `@tanstack/react-query` Managing fetched data from API Endpoints
- `zeego` - Native Dropdown and Context Menus
- `react-native-mmkv` - Key-Value Storage for User Preferences
- `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` - Bottom Sheet component

# Run Locally

The app requires an Expo Development Build to be able to run on Android or iOS, due to the dependencies it is using. This section of the README will be updated with steps on how to create and install the development build for yourself.

<!-- ### Pre-requisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Android/iOS Emulator (A Physical Device works as well)

Considering the dependencies being used in this Expo project, you should be able to run the app using Expo Go.

### Installation

1. Clone this Repository, then change directory to the React-Native-Magic-8-Ball directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChitrakshTarun/PaceManApp.git
```

```
cd PaceManApp
```

2. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

3.

```
npx expo start
```

Either scan the QR code using Expo Go on your device, or use an Android/IOS emulator with Expo Go. -->

<!-- # To-do (way too much)

- Configure Leaderboard Page
- Configure Events Page
- Configure Stats Page
- Add support for more color themes (look into `tw-colors`)
- Animations for FlatList (identify how to manage prev vs curr data in Query)
- Android bugs (tab bar icons disappearing, etc.)
- Look into Push Notifications (will need to find a way to configure without spamming the API in the background)

## Done

âœ… ~~`/lb/[id]` File-based routing tweaks to support deep-linking.~~ -->
